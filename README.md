Ask Spingel Bobel your most sought after question, responds!

In any channel this bot has read and send message permissions, mentioning the bot with a question will prompt Png!

The general layout is as follows: `@Spingel Bobel#6666 [question]?`

For example, `@Spingel Bobel#6666 can I have something to eat?` will have the bot create a .GIF response sent in the channel which it received the question [like so](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/476812281984974870/709633975932682351/out.gif)
