For each logged message, the following information is collected and logged:
 * The message author's ID

No other information is collected (for example, pfp, presence, about me, message metadata [such as date, ID, guild, channel], etc). 
All logged author ID's, usernames, and trigged message contents are also deleted on a 15 day rotation period.

# Data Use
